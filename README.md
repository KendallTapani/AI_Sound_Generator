This is a Nextjs app that uses the Elevenlabs sound-generation endpoint to Generate and Play audio, using the inputted text. It is difficult to get complex sounds, and it is easier to generate really good individual sounds, save the file, and edit them in an audio editor, and that is what the app does.


Very good product, editing the individual sounds in Audacity makes a really good end result.
